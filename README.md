# Reveal-md Starter

This starter uses [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to bootstrap a slides repo with custom styling and fonts (to successfully present when offline), and the ability to deploy to Github pages.

## Usage

### Installation

To use this starter, you must have both [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) and [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) installed locally. These are not installed via the project because they are too large to install in every individual project.

```
$ npm install reveal-md gh-pages -g
```

### Scripts

To **run** the slides locally, watching for changes in style or content:

```
$ npm start
```

To create a **build** in the `/build/` folder:

```
$ npm run build
```

To **deploy** the `/build/` folder to Github pages:

```
$ npm run deploy
```

To **export to pdf** to `slides.pdf` in 1024x768 resolution, run ([more info](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md#print-to-pdf)):

```
$ npm run print
```

## Slides and Controls

To advance the slides, use `n` for next and `p` for previous. The right arrow jumps to the next section (and left for previous section). Up and down to advance through slides within a section.
